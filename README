# Perl module App::IsGitSynced

This is source code for Perl module App::IsGitSynced.

## I want to use it!

The GitHub repo https://github.com/bessarabov/App-IsGitSynced contaings the
source code for the module App::IsGitSynced. Before going to CPAN the source
code is being converted, so if you need to use the module you should take it
from CPAN: https://metacpan.org/module/App::IsGitSynced
