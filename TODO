# TODO

## nearest version

## next versions

 * Add Test::Whitespaces
 * make dist::zilla add version number to file `is_git_synced` and make that
   file independent from lib/App/IsGitSynced.pm
 * minimize running external programms. Just once run `git status --porcelain`
   and parce the output
 * output detailed info about what branch has changes
 * maybe I should not store lib/App/IsGitSynced.pm in git repo because it is
   generated from the script? and maybe I can remote that file. The same
   question about README, but it is needed for pretty view in github.
